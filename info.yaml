# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "MinAXIL: Gate-Lean 8-bit AXI-Lite Peripheral (TT Harness Compliant)"
  author:       "Dr. Sowmya K B, Dr. Shilpa D R, Dr. Veenadivya K"
  discord:      "Sowmya K B, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)"
  description:  "AXI4-Lite TinyTapeout peripheral that reads a byte, processes it (bitwise invert), and returns the result via a minimal VALID/READY register interface"
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz: 25000000  # 25 MHz (synchronous design uses clk)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_axi8_lite_proc"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.

# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
# This section is for the datasheet/website. Use descriptive names (e.g., RX, TX, MOSI, SCL, SEG_A, etc.).
pinout:
  # Inputs
  ui[0]: "AWVALID — write address valid (from AXI master)"
  ui[1]: "ARVALID — read address valid (from AXI master)"
  ui[2]: "WVALID — write data valid (from AXI master)"
  ui[3]: "RREADY — read data ready/accept (from AXI master)"
  ui[4]: "BREADY — write response ready/accept (from AXI master)"
  ui[5]: "ADDR[0] — register select: 0=input reg, 1=output reg"
  ui[6]: "WSTRB[0] — byte write enable (set to 1 for writes)"
  ui[7]: "Reserved/unused (tie to 0)"

  # Outputs
  uo[0]: "AWREADY — write address ready (from DUT)"
  uo[1]: "WREADY — write data ready (from DUT)"
  uo[2]: "BVALID — write response valid (from DUT)"
  uo[3]: "ARREADY — read address ready (from DUT)"
  uo[4]: "RVALID — read data valid (from DUT)"
  uo[5]: "RDATA[0] — debug: LSB of processed data"
  uo[6]: "Unused (drives 0)"
  uo[7]: "Heartbeat (slow toggle for bring-up)"

  # Bidirectional pins
  uio[0]: "Data bus D0 — WDATA[0] on writes (driven by master); RDATA[0] on reads (driven by DUT when RVALID=1)"
  uio[1]: "Data bus D1 — WDATA[1] / RDATA[1]"
